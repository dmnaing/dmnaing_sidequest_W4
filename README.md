## Description

This is a small platformer prototype built using JSON-driven level data and reusable classes. Platforms and the goal zone are generated from external level data using loops, allowing new levels to be added without modifying the core game logic. The player navigates platforms and reaches the goal to automatically advance to the next level.

## Setup and Interaction Instructions

- Open the GitHub Pages link in Google Chrome.
- **Move:** A / D or Left / Right Arrow keys
- **Jump:** Space, W, or Up Arrow
- **Goal:** Reach the green goal zone to load the next level
- **Optional:** Press **N** to manually skip to the next level

## Learning Goals

a. Post-Playtest (3 changes)

1. Added a visible goal zone defined in JSON to clarify the win condition.
2. Adjusted platform spacing to make jumps more readable and intentional.
3. Implemented automatic level progression when the goal is reached.

b. Post-Showcase (2 planned improvements)

1. Add visual feedback when the player reaches the goal (animation or text).
2. Introduce hazards or alternate platform types using JSON data.
